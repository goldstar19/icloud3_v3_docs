# Sample Automations & Scripts

The following automations and scripts are one example of how I My setup is using using iCloud3 for presence detection. Specifically, these show how I open my garage door when I arrive home.

I have an ESP32 running ESPHome that is connected to my garage door that creates several HA entities:

- *switch.garage_door* - Opens and closes it just like a wall mounted switch.
- *sensor.garage_door* - Detects if the door is open or closed.
- *sensor.garage_door_distance* - Measures where the door is when it is opening or closing

I use several entities:

- *input_boolean.ha_started_flag* - Prevents the door from opening when HA has just been restarted.
- *input_boolean.gary_far_away_flag* - Set when Gary is more than 5 miles from Home.
- *sensor.someone_home* - Indicates if someone is home, no one is home or everyone is away

I use the following iCloud3 sensors and sensor attributes:

- *gary_iphone_distance_home* - Distance to Home.  I could also use *sensor.gary_iphone_distance_home* or *sensor.gary_iphone_distance_warehouse* when tracking from several zones.
- *gary_iphone_zone_name* - Set to the zone name (Home) when in the zone.
- *sensor.gary_iphone_zone_distance/max_distance attribute* - Set to the 0 when exiting the zone, then set to the furthest distance from the zone while traveling. This is used to see when I went more than 2 miles and probably driving rather than leaving the Home zone and just walking around the neighborhood. I could also use *sensor.gary_iphone_distance_home/max_distance attribute* or *sensor.gary_iphone_distance_warehouse/max_distance attribute* when tracking from several zones.

My goal is to 

- Open the garage door when I arrive home.
- Detect if the garage door is open when it should not e.
- Display badges showing the stage of the garage door and location of people.
- Be able to check the status of the garage door.
- Close it manually if it is open when it should not be.
- Close it if everyone is far away from Home.

The following automations and scripts does this reliably as long as I have a good cell signal and the GPS accuracy is within limits. These automations and scripts can be adapted for many other tasks (lights, security system, locks, camera operations, etc).

          FarAway
        {% elif (is_state("sensor.gary_iphone_zone_name", "Home") == false)
