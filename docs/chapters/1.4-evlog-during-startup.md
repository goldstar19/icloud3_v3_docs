# Event Log During Startup

When iCloud3 starts,  a number of events take place where it sets up the configuration, zones, support structure, devices and sensors. The results of this process are shown in the Event Log. The information in these startup stages can help identify errors with tracked devices, parameters and actual device data in the Apple iCloud account and associated with the iOS App.

Below are examples of each stage.

------
### Stage 1 - Initial Preparation

During the *Initial Preparation* stage:

- The iCloud3 directory is identified.
- The version of the Event Log is checked to verify the latest version is being used. It will be updated and a message is sent to all devices if necessary.
- The Apple iCloud account login process is started if the username/password is available. If not available, the login process will be done later.

### Stage 4 - Setup iCloud & iOS App Tracking Methods

During the *Setup iCloud & iOS APP Tracking Methods* stage:

- The devices in the Family Sharing list and the Find-my-Friends list in the Apple iCloud account are identified.
- The devices in the HA device and entity registries are read and identified.
- The iCloud3 devices are linked to those in the Family Sharing list, the Find-my-Friends list and the iOS App device list.
- The devices in each of these lists that are not associated with an iCloud3 device are identified.

!> The final verification of each device is done during this stage. Configuration errors due to a change in device names, device_tracker entity name errors and unavailable devices are reported.
